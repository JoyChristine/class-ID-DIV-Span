# class-ID-DIV-Span

Practicing the difference between **divs and spans, class and ID**.

Both classes and IDs can be targeted by CSS rules (classes with a . and IDs with a # symbol).

The important difference is that IDs are unique, while classes are not unique. 

We can use the same class on multiple elements, while IDs must be unique to a single element on the page.
